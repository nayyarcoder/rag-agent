This is a sample document for testing the document ingestion process.

The document contains multiple paragraphs to test the text splitting functionality.

This paragraph contains information about artificial intelligence and machine learning.
AI systems can process large amounts of data and learn patterns from it.
Machine learning models can be trained on various types of data including text, images, and audio.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that focuses on understanding and generating human language.
NLP applications include machine translation, sentiment analysis, and question answering systems.
Modern NLP systems use transformer architectures and large language models to achieve state-of-the-art results.

Vector databases are essential for building efficient retrieval systems.
They store document embeddings and enable semantic search capabilities.
This allows us to find relevant information based on meaning rather than just keywords.
